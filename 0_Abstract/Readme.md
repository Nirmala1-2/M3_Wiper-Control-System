Wiper is an essential component that used to clean raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper.

In this project we are trying to simulate the wiper control system on software.
